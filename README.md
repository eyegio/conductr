## Inspiration

Website builders like Wix and Squarespace have become increasingly popular to help non-technical folks build basic websites. However, for the lesser technical peeps, there’s a lot of room for improvement. We believe intelligent voice-command for building websites helps remove some of the confusion around using website builders, and that’s how Conductr was born.

## What it does
Conductr is the first-ever website builder powered by voice-command. We use IBM-Watson’s speech-to-text and conversation API to build website components with vocal commands.

## How we built it
Configured IBM-Watson’s speech-to-text and conversation API to recognize basic intents in building a simple website (select item, create row, create image, increase/decrease font size, among others ).
Linked IBM-Watson’s command-system to our back-end in node.js to receive commands and translate them into useful functions that users may want to use to build/modify a website. 
Front-end was built in React.js.

## What's next for conductr
World domination.
